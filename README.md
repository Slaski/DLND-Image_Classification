# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations

## Project 2 - Image Classification

This is the second project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree from [Udacity](http://udacity.com).
In this project we have to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),
which consists of several images of airplanes, dogs, cats and other objects.

## Dependencies

* numpy
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* tensorflow

Install missing depencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and/or [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Tensorflow can be installed via this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal to see the code.
